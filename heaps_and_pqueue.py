#heaps/priority queue (ordered by p-value)
#binary heap is min or max depending on pqueue looking for min or max
#heaps are Binary trees, considered complete: every level is full, except last one
#the order value: recursively, all vals in left are less than root, vice a versa
#these are just implemented using arrays and dont care about the 0th ind place root at 1
#left child = 2*i, right child = 2*i + 1 and parent = i//2, only true because complete T
